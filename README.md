Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
     The client Artemis Financial was a company that made financial software that was used by different companies and agencies around the globe. The issue that they wanted to address was to find out what our client needed for their project and to use Maven to find dependency problems.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
    I was good at finding the vulnerabilities by reading the html and researching in order to find out if the vulnerabilities were false positives or not. Secure software helps a company because they are less likely to be attacked from the outside, and this allows them to keep their reputation with their customers so they can continue to profit and expand.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
     The part that was difficult about the assessment was having to document all of the vulnerabilities. It took forever and a lot of them were false positives.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
     It's always important to understand the type of program that you are making and since money kinda rules the world everyone is looking to attack financial companies so the strategies I would employ involve using slower hashing methods that are private between parties.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
     I ensured that the code was secure by running Maven and checking out the dependency chart, then after refactoring the code and removing false positives I did the same thing again in order to ensure the security of the program.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
     The dependency tool is a wonderful tool that I will definitely use in the future if I'm using Java and creating an app in Eclipse.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
     I would want to show that I have a decent understanding of security and am able to implement and use security software to find vulnerabilities and other problems with the software that is being  created.
